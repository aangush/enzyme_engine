# Enzyme Engine by Aidan

### A Comparative Genomics Pipeline for Discovering Functional Gene Modules and Exploring Bacterial Protein Diversity

---

### Overview
Enzyme Engine is a bioinformatics tool designed to find and map genomic neighborhood networks of prokaryotic protein homologs. It combines BLAST discovery with local synteny analysis and domain identification to reveal conserved genetic modules across phyla.

This project was inspired by my experiences (and frustrations) working with poorly characterized biochemcial pathways for metabolic engineering, and by the [Enzyme Function Initiative Tools](https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/). It is my attempt to streamline, optimize, and expand on comparative genomic context searching to find functional proteins for a pathway of interest.

*Furthermore, this project was born from a desire to show that there are more ways to observe, characterize, and harness biodiversity than to aimlessly feed it into LLMs.*
